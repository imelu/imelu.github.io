                "Fulfil the shadow girl's dreams by dragging the children's toys from the shelves and dropping them onto the table to create a shadow play. Embark on a wild journey through space and time by recreating silhouettes close to the template in the spotlight to make it real.",
                "In addition to the story mode, you can also be creative and make your own custom levels to give your friends and family even tougher challenges.",
                "The first version of this game was created during the Brackeys GameJam 2022 and is currently in further development."
